I am a PhD student at the Computer Sciences and Engineering department at University of Michigan, advised by [Nishil Talati](https://sites.google.com/site/nishiltalatipersonal/?pli=1) and [Ronald Dreslinski](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/people/dreslinski-ronald/). 
Recently, I also work closely with [Lin Ma](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~linmacse/) on database related research.
I received my BSE in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2021, later completed my MSE at the University of Michigan in 2023. 

My research interest is novel computer system and architecture for emerging data-intensive applications.
On the system side, I develop high-performance GPU-accelerated solutions. 


Ongoing and past research
======
Recently, I am working on resolving IO bottleneck for GPU-based database workloads.

In the past, I worked on GPU acceleration for Graph Analytics.
My work [Everest](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/17/paper/Everest%3A%20GPU-Accelerated%20System%20For%20Mining%20Temporal%20Motifs) was accepted by VLDB 2024. 
Everest is a GPU-based system that can efficiently mine temporal motifs from large graphs.
