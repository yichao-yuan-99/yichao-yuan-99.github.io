I am a PhD student at the Computer Sciences and Engineering department at University of Michigan, advised by [Ronald Dreslinski](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/people/dreslinski-ronald/) and [Nishil Talati](https://sites.google.com/site/nishiltalatipersonal/?pli=1). 
I received my BSE in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2021, later completed my MSE at the University of Michigan in 2023. 

My research interest is novel computer architecture and system for emerging data-intensive applications.


Ongoing and past research
======
I am working on the [AGILE](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/agile) project and developing new techniques for irregular data-intensive applications at scale.
Recently, my work [Everest](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/17/paper/Everest%3A%20GPU-Accelerated%20System%20For%20Mining%20Temporal%20Motifs) has been accepted by VLDB 2024. 
Everest is a GPU-based system that can efficiently mine temporal motifs from large graphs.
