I am a PhD student in the Computer Sciences and Engineering department at University of Michigan, advised by [Nishil Talati](https://sites.google.com/site/nishiltalatipersonal/?pli=1) and [Ronald Dreslinski](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/people/dreslinski-ronald/). 
Recently, I have also been working closely with [Lin Ma](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~linmacse/) on database-related research.
I received my BSE in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2021, later completed my MSE at the University of Michigan in 2023. 

My research interests are novel computer systems and architectures for emerging data-intensive applications.
On the systems side, I develop high-performance GPU-accelerated solutions. 


Ongoing and past research
======
Currently, I am working on resolving I/O bottleneck for GPU-based database workloads.

In the past, I worked on GPU acceleration for Graph Analytics.
My work [Everest](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/17/paper/Everest%3A%20GPU-Accelerated%20System%20For%20Mining%20Temporal%20Motifs) was accepted to VLDB 2024. 
Everest is a GPU-based system that can efficiently mine temporal motifs from large graphs.
